- 👋 Hi, I am Ayibadeinyefa. I build systems that hold their own in real environments.
- I work across cloud architecture, backend development, and automation. I take unclear requests and turn them into working services.
- I care about clean structure, strong security, and solutions that stay stable when things get busy.
- I am working toward the Principal Solutions Architect level, and I shape my projects with that standard in mind.
